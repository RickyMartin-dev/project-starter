# Low-friction automation

The default path is intentionally automatic. A user should be able to focus on the product while the active coding agent keeps orientation, local context, verification, and handoff artifacts current.

## What happens automatically

At the start of a substantive agent session, the agent runs:

```bash
./scripts/project start --task "the user's request"
```

This command is idempotent and local-only. It:

- detects common language, package, build, test, and source signals without installing anything;
- refreshes `.agent-state/session-context.md`, which is ignored machine-local context;
- installs the repository's project-local Git hooks;
- checks the starter contract;
- surfaces deterministic upgrade suggestions.

At the end of a meaningful session, the agent runs:

```bash
./scripts/project finish --summary "short outcome"
```

This command:

- runs the starter and release checks;
- creates an automatic compaction snapshot under `docs/compactions/`;
- updates `docs/state/automatic-handoff.md`;
- records only sanitized, repository-local facts;
- leaves all policy, credential, permission, and external-side-effect decisions reviewable.

The generated local context is deliberately ignored so routine orientation does not dirty the worktree. Automatic compaction and handoff records are durable Git artifacts because they are part of the project's second brain.

## Agent adapter behavior

`prompts/autopilot.md` is the shared operating instruction. Codex uses `AGENTS.md`; Claude Code and Cursor expose `/autopilot`. The adapters all point to the same contract so switching tools does not fork the workflow.

The agent should not ask the user to manually maintain routine project-management files. It should do the following automatically:

1. orient and detect the repository;
2. plan only when the task is larger than a trivial change;
3. implement the user's requested work;
4. run the documented project checks plus starter checks;
5. capture a compaction snapshot and handoff;
6. surface only decisions that genuinely require owner authority.

## What remains intentionally gated

Automation does not grant an agent hidden credentials, unrestricted network access, production authority, automatic policy promotion, or unbounded specialist spawning. Those actions are high-impact and require explicit project-owner approval. Agents can draft and verify the supporting artifacts automatically.

## Recovery

If an agent forgets the loop, run:

```bash
./scripts/project start
./scripts/project finish --summary "recovered the session workflow"
```

The latest durable resume point is always `docs/state/automatic-handoff.md`, followed by the newest file in `docs/compactions/`.
