# Agent Workflow

This is the repeatable operating system for work in this repository. Adapt the commands and artifacts to the project, but keep the state transitions visible.

## 1. Orient

Read `AGENTS.md` and the task-relevant parts of `docs/project-brief.md`. Read `docs/project-commands.md` before running checks, `docs/architecture.md` when changing boundaries or data flow, and the relevant plan or decision when one exists. Search before assuming. Identify the smallest set of files that can solve the request.

## 2. Plan

For work larger than a trivial edit, create a plan with:

- the problem and non-goals;
- assumptions and open decisions;
- implementation steps in dependency order;
- acceptance criteria;
- exact verification commands;
- rollback or recovery notes for risky changes.

Keep plans executable. A plan is not a second requirements document.

## 3. Implement

Make one coherent change at a time. Prefer existing patterns and dependencies. Keep user-facing behavior, documentation, tests, and configuration in sync. Do not broaden scope because an adjacent improvement is interesting.

## 4. Verify

Run the narrowest useful check after each meaningful change, then the full documented gate before completion. Test failure paths, not just the happy path. If a check cannot run, say why and provide the next best evidence.

## 5. Review

Review the diff as if you did not write it. Look for broken assumptions, missing tests, unsafe input handling, secret leakage, migration hazards, compatibility issues, and unnecessary complexity. A second agent can review, but the owner remains responsible for the decision.

## 6. Learn

Capture durable outcomes only:

- use `docs/decisions/` for choices with alternatives and consequences;
- use `docs/lessons.md` for recurring practices and failure patterns;
- use `docs/retrospectives/` for a bounded project's what/why/next time;
- update `docs/architecture.md` when the system map changes.

Do not turn every conversation into permanent context. Delete stale guidance.

## Research and improvement loops

Use a scout report for bounded research and a ship plan for authorized changes. Scouts return evidence, alternatives, and a handoff; they do not quietly edit production code. Ship work has an owner, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence.

For improvements to code, prompts, or process, use the experiment loop in `docs/experiments/`: baseline → hypothesis → bounded run → measure → keep or discard/revert. Keep the evaluator stable, record the result, and promote only evidence-backed lessons. Append durable verification evidence to `docs/verification-log.md`.

## 7. Compact and recover

Before a long session ends, a context window compacts, or work moves between agents, run `./scripts/project compact <slug>`. Complete the generated snapshot with rationale, uncertainty, evidence, unfinished work, and one next safe action. Update `docs/state/handoff.md` to point to the snapshot. Facts are generated from the repository; interpretation remains explicitly authored.

## 8. Research and suggest upgrades

Use `./scripts/project research <slug> "<question>"` for a dated comparison of current practice. Use `./scripts/project suggest-upgrades --json` to surface deterministic signals such as placeholders, missing compaction history, or absent proposals. Create a proposal with `./scripts/project upgrade <slug> "<title>"`, then require evidence before promotion. Suggestions never edit the repository by themselves.

## 9. Route specialist work

Use `./scripts/project specialist <slug> "<role>"` to draft a bounded Markdown role card. A coordinator may hand it to Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, or another harness, but only after a reviewer confirms inputs, outputs, write scope, evidence, rollback, and trust boundaries. Specialist cards are portable interfaces; they are not automatic permission to spawn agents or install tools.

## 10. Promote learning

Use `docs/state/proposals/` for project-specific improvement proposals. The designated reviewer agent may approve a proposal only after checking its evidence, scope, rollback, secret safety, and prompt-injection boundary. Apply the smallest durable change and record the evidence in `docs/verification-log.md`.

## 11. Complete

Confirm acceptance criteria, move the plan to `docs/plans/completed/`, update the changelog when appropriate, and report verification evidence plus known limitations.

## Parallel work

Parallelize independent research or review. Give each worker a narrow output contract. Isolate concurrent code changes with git worktrees or separate branches. Merge only after each result has a named owner, a reviewable diff, and passing verification. Keep scout reports separate from ship branches until a human or task owner authorizes implementation.
